# Udemy Courses Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Udemy courses to uncover insights into sales trends, pricing strategies, and subject popularity. Using Python, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand what makes a course successful on the platform.

## Features
* **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and formatted data for analysis.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized course distributions across different subjects.
* **Pricing Analysis**: Analyzed the relationship between course price and the number of subscribers.

## Tools & Technologies
* **Python**: The core language used for analysis.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: The environment where the analysis was conducted (`uadmy.ipynb`).

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the `udemy_courses_clean.csv` file, which contains records of various courses, including their titles, prices, and subscriber counts.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pandas installed.
3. Open `uadmy.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to see the analysis steps.
